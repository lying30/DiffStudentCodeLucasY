| Feb 27 |   9-10am   | I attempted the tabulation approach utilizing the methodology we developed in class as a table group. Then I focused on creating a 2d table that tracked the longest shared substring as it went. If it was a match I would check just the diagnolly to the left box to take as the last piece of data and update that by adding one, but if it wasnt a match then I took the largest previous substring from the box above and to the left of the current box. I went through from the bottom up to check all the boxes --> hence tabulation and then found the solution in the most bottom right box. I had a problem with going out of bounds on the left and above with the first row and first column so I added a blank row and column to help me avoid those out of bounds errors. |
